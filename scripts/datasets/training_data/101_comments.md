[1] todsacerdoti: Tools for 2025
[1.1] gigatexal: I really do like these kinds of posts. I like the author’s passion. Will check oils, radicle, and simplex out. Though I think getting my wife to try simplex over iMessage is unlikely to happen hah
[1.2] patrickhogan1: Thanks for the great write-up—Radicle and Simplex Chat look awesome, and I’m looking forward to checking them out!One tool that recently gave me that (PP-removed double brackets here) this is how it should work feeling was Flighty (iOS flight tracking). The UI, functionality, and flow felt so seamless—it was like music to my technophile ears. I wasn't even expecting much, because it was like "meh, its a flight tracker." But, it really wowed me.(PP-removed angle brackets heere)I always justify my tool obsession by saying that after installing thousands of tools and apps, you become a naturally good product manager. Because you have a high bar for quality and during the planning/mockup phase you have lots of patterns in your head of what great looks like.
[1.3] oguz-ismail: (PP-removed angle brackets here) Nah. Bash is well-maintained, you can have a bug fixed quickly. It's been months since I reported this (PP-removed angle brackets here) and still nothing.
